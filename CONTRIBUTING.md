Contributing to Simbody
=======================
**(work in progress)**

Simbody is a community resource and we encourage you to contribute in whatever way you can -- for example: new code, bug fixes, test cases, and examples; documentation improvements and typo fixes; bug reports, feature requests, ideas and discussion topics; and user forum questions and answers. We appreciate contributions and our development team is collaborative and constructive -- don't be shy! 

**Important note:** Simbody is an open source project licensed under extremely flexible terms intended to encourage use by *anyone*, for *any purpose*. We *want* people to use our software and we *do not want* to restrict how they use it nor to control their behavior. When you make a contribution to the Simbody project, **you are agreeing** to do so under those same terms. The details are [below](#contributor-license-agreement); if you aren't comfortable with those terms, we're still friends but you shouldn't contribute.

  4. You are capable of granting these rights for the contribution.

If your contribution contains others' open source code licensed under Apache 2.0 or other non-viral license like BSD or MIT, it is probably fine. But be sure to mention that in the Pull Request you submit so we can discuss it.
